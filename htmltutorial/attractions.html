        <dd class="eight">Athangudi village is located in Sivaganga district of Tamil Nadu and is 24 km from Karaikudi. The village itself comes within the Chettinad area and is very famous all over the country for the hand-made terracotta tiles that are made only here. The tiles are built using cement, sand, synthetic oxides and belly jelly. The terracotta tiles are first shaped and then sun-dried after which they are adorned with artistically made patterns. It is the pattern that gives the tiles their unique texture. The pattern can be decorated with various colours to make the tiles look attractive. People also get customised tiles made for their houses and lawns. The most popular design on tiles for lawns is the one depicting flora and fauna. You can also get the tiles in the colours matching your walls and upholstery. People in the village of Athangudi tend to use these tiles for increasing the appeal of their houses. In fact, the tiles are a common feature in many ancestral houses.

        <dd class="eight">Aayiram Jannal Veedu is a famous landmark in the town of Karaikudi. The literal translation of the name of the place means the house with a thousand windows; a very apt name for a house that has thousand windows! The house is very famous among the tourists who make it a point to visit the place when in Karaikudi. In fact, once in the town, simply ask anyone for directions to the house. Built in 1941 on 20,000 square feet of area, the house is very spacious and costed 1 lakh 25 thousand at the time, a meager sum of money now. The house has 25 huge rooms and five very large halls. There are some 20 doors in the house along with 1000 windows. The first thing that strikes when one enters the house is that although it is in shambles and poorly maintained, the original style of architecture and grandeur still remains intact.

        <dd class="eight"> Kaviarasu Kannadasan Manimandapam is a small structure that has been built in the memory of famous Tamil poet Kavi Arasar Kannadasan who was born in Sirukoodalpatti, a sleepy village near Karaikudi. He was a man who is believed to have changed the face of Tamil literature with his revolutionary writings. He also had great oratorical skills and would mesmerise his audience when he took the stage. He contributed not only to Tamil literature but also to the Tamil film industry by writing songs that became very popular. Many of his writings also found their way into Tamil magazines since he also wrote political satires. His writings have taken on an iconic stature in the state of Tamil Nadu because he gave the Tamilians the voice they were lacking. In his work, he spoke about the problems of the common people; their fears as well as their joys. The Nagarathars built a mandapam for him to honour the man who made their community known all over the country.

    <dt><h2 style="color: rgb(92, 55, 10)";>IDAIKATTUR CHURCH</h2></dt>
    <dd class="eight">The history of this church is as rich and captivating as its architecture. It was built by Mary Anne, a French Anglican lady who, after suffering from a serious ailment that doctors couldn't cure, prayed for nine days to the Sacred Heart of Jesus on the advice of three Roman Catholic ladies. Miraculously, her prayers were answered, and she was cured of her illness. To thank God, she donated 2,000 Francs to construct the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Idaikattur. The church was Fr. Ferdinand Celle SJ's vision; he had hoped to build a larger church to accommodate 1000 people but lacked the funds and local support. Mary Anne met Fr. Ferdinand during his trip to France to collect money, and at her request, the church was built in the same style as the Rheims Cathedral.
